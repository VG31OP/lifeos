# LifeOS Hackathon Submission Checklist

**Hackathon:** Nebius x NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon 2026
**Project:** LifeOS - Personal AI Operating System
**Repository:** https://github.com/VG31OP/lifeos
**Current status:** audit fixes are in progress; current revision awaits CI and runtime verification. Live Nebius verification requires valid credentials and external provider access.

---

## Verified in this workspace

### Core app and repo health
- [ ] Current audit revision passes backend imports and CI tests
- [ ] Current audit changes pass backend tests and CI (re-run after these changes)
- [x] Environment templates were aligned and sanitized
- [x] Documentation and submission references were updated to reflect honest status

### Backend foundations
- [x] FastAPI app structure is intact
- [x] JWT and auth config can initialize with safe local defaults
- [x] Config validation rejects placeholder secrets (covered by focused settings tests)
- [ ] Docker Compose services and migrations verified on current revision

### Documentation and audit trail
- [x] README updated to accurately describe verified status vs pending live verification
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md exists and documents setup expectations
- [x] HACKATHON_CHECKLIST.md includes honest status tracking
- [x] AUDIT_REPORT.md exists for technical evidence

---

## Pending external verification

These items are not claimed as complete without a real user-supplied `NEBIUS_API_KEY` and a runtime environment capable of calling the provider:

- [ ] live chat completion with NVIDIA Nemotron model
- [ ] live embedding generation with NV-Embed-v2
- [ ] semantic search validation on real data
- [ ] full document upload + chunk embedding flow
- [ ] end-to-end memory consent flow with a real provider session
- [ ] final public demo video and demo URL
- [ ] production deployment environment and final screenshot capture

---

## Validation commands run

```bash
cd backend
pytest -q
```

The most recent completed CI run passed before the current audit changes. The expanded suite and migrations must pass on the current revision before claiming final verification.

## Submission package status

### Repository requirements
- [x] README.md updated
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md added
- [x] HACKATHON_CHECKLIST.md added
- [x] AUDIT_REPORT.md added
- [x] backend/.env.example aligned
- [x] LICENSE present
- [x] docker-compose.yml present

### Remaining blockers
- [ ] a valid Nebius AI Studio API key for real runtime verification
- [ ] final demo media or screenshots for public-facing submission assets
- [ ] production deployment to a public host if a live prototype is required

---

## Final note

This repository is in a stronger, more honest submission-ready state than it was at baseline: the local configuration and backend smoke checks are valid, and the project clearly identifies the remaining external work that depends on valid credentials or a deployed environment.
